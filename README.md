# SecureMsg (CI-ready)

Upload this repo to GitHub and use Actions to build the APK.

## Build with GitHub Actions
- Open Actions tab after pushing to `main`
- Download the `SecureMsg-debug-apk` artifact

## Notes
- This CI uses a system-installed Gradle (downloaded in the workflow), not the wrapper.
